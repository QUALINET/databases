Human fixation data is recorded during an eye tracking experiment using the Eyelink head-mounted eye tracking system (SR research). Fixation locations were extracted using the accompanied software. The images were displayed full-screen with a resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels on an 18 inch crt monitor of 36 by 27 cm at a distance of 70Â cm from the participants. The eye tracker was calibrated using the Eyelink software. The calibration was verified prior to each session, and recalibrated if needed. The participants were asked to free view the images. We did not give the participants a task, since we are interested in the bottom-up components of visual attention. A task would give a strong top-down influence on the eye movements. The experiment was carried out by 31 students of the University of Groningen. The participants ranged from 17 to 32 years old, among them 15 females and 16 males with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The experiment was split up into sessions of approximately 5 minutes. Between the sessions, the experimenter had a short relaxing conversation with the participants, in order to get them motivated and focused for the next session. Before starting a new session, the calibration of the eye tracker was verified. After each presented images, drift was measured and corrected if needed using the Eyelink software.
