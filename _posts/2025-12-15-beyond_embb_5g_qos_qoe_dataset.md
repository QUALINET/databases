This dataset accompanies the best paper award-winning research presented at IEEE CSCN'24 in Belgrade (November 2024). It contains empirical measurements evaluating quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) metrics for advanced 5G network capabilities beyond enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), focusing on real-time interactive services.

The dataset includes results from a large-scale measurement campaign conducted on two 5G networks in Sweden during 2023 (8.0 MB of measurement data), along with the accepted paper version and comprehensive documentation. The methodology leverages a lightweight, recently standardized ITU-T procedure that defines a QoE indicator called the Interactivity Score, based on QoS metrics quantifying service latency, stability, and continuity.

This research is part of the INTERACT-B5G project and reflects multi-year collaboration between Karlstad University, Sapienza University of Rome, University of Oslo, and Rohde & Schwarz. The work advances understanding of the impact of system configurations and environmental conditions on QoS/QoE performance in 5G and Beyond-5G networks.
