The DIEM project is an investigation of how people look and see. DIEM has so far collected data from over 250 participants watching 85 different videos. All of our data is freely available for research and non-commercial use as restricted by a CC-NC-SA 3.0 Creative Commons license. The data together with CARPE will let you visualize where people look during dynamic scene viewing such as during film trailers, music videos, or advertisements. The project was made possible by generous funding from the Leverhulme Trust and the Economic and Social Research Council of the UK. Datasets come with CARPE, or Computational and Algorithmic Representation and Processing of Eye-movements, allows one to begin visualizing eye-movement data in a number of ways.
