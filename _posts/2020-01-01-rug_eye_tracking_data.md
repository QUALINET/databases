Human fixation data during an eye tracking experiment using the Eyelink head-mounted eye tracking system (SR research). Fixation locations were extracted using the accompanied software. The images were displayed full-screen with a resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels on an 18 inch crt monitor of 36 by 27 cm at a distance of 70 cm from the participants. The eye tracker was calibrated using the Eyelink software. The calibration was verified prior to each session, and recalibrated if needed. The participants were asked to free view the images. The experiment was carried out by 31 students of the University of Groningen.
