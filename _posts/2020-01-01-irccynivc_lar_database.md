8 original color images were used (4 natural images: Jpeg.org DB and 4 art images: EROS DB), 120 distorted images were generated from 3 different processing, and 5 compression rates. Compressions considered: JPEG, JPEG2000, LAR coding. These algorithms have the advantage to generate very different type of distortions. Subjective evaluations were made at viewing distance of 6 times the screen height using a DSIS (Double Stimulus Impairment Scale) method with 5 categories and 20 observers. Distortions for each processing and each image have been optimized in order to uniformly cover the subjective scale.
