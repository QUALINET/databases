Publicly available dataset of 20 HDR images, covering typical use cases and acquisition methods, including fusion from several images with different exposures, frames from HDR video, and CGI images. Some of the original images were taken from other public datasets, but the HDR images were re-generated and then adapted (resized, cropped, and tone-mapped using display-adaptive tone-mapping operator) to SIM2 HDR monitor. The dataset provides compressed versions of the display-adapted HDR images by three JPEG~XT profiles, referred to as profiles A, B, and C. The encoding parameters of the compressed images were carefully selected by the expert viewers using SIM2 HDR monitor to ensure four different bit rate levels similar for the three profiles. The dataset also includes the MOS values obtained from the subjective evaluation of HDR images compressed using three profiles, which was conducted in a specialized test laboratory using Double Stimulus Impairment Scale (DSIS) methodology and 24 naive subjects. The proposed dataset, to the best of our knowledge, is the most extensive public dataset of HDR images compressed with all three profiles of JPEG~XT and with the corresponding MOS values.
