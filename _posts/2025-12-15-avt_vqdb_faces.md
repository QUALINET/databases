This 4K HDR face video quality database features face-focused video content developed by the Audiovisual Technology Group at TU Ilmenau for video quality assessment studies, particularly relevant for videoconferencing applications. The dataset is part of research on viewing distance effects and video quality perception in scenarios where human faces are the primary content.

The dataset contains 175 total source videos with 34 subjects per lighting scenario. The structure includes 4 distinct lighting scenarios plus one looped scenario combining all lighting conditions, enabling research on how lighting affects perceived quality of face videos in high dynamic range format.

This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the ILMETA project, and the PoQuMo8K project.
