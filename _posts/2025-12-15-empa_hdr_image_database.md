This collection emerged from HDR research conducted at Empa between 2011-2013. It contains 33 scenes, consisting of images from exposure bracketing, resulting EXR or HDR files, and tone-mapped JPEGs. Additionally, three image sequences are included for time-lapse or stop-motion video creation.

The database was partially supported by COST action IC1005 on HDRI.
