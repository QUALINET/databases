This dataset contains exported data from Bitmovin Analytics, a comprehensive video analytics system facilitating Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment. The data was collected as part of the 5GENESIS project (5th Generation End-to-end Network, Experimentation, System Integration, and Showcasing) at the Berlin facility.

The dataset consists of a CSV file (139.4 kB) containing video streaming analytics metrics including resolution and bitrate data. This work was conducted by a collaboration of four research institutions: Simula Research Laboratory, Fraunhofer FOKUS, IHP GmbH, and Humboldt University of Berlin.

The 5GENESIS project (Grant agreement ID: 815178) was funded by the European Commission and ran from July 2018 to December 2021, focusing on 5G network testing and experimentation.
