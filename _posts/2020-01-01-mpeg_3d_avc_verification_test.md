Database used for the MPEG 3D-AVC verification test. A total of 4 multiview video plus depth (MVD) sequences were encoded with MVC+D and 3D-AVC at 4 rate points. From the original and decoded data, 2 sets of stereo pairs were generated: 1 pair with 1 decoded view and 1 synthesized view; 1 pair with 2 synthesized views. The database contains a total of 72 stereo pairs. The stereo pairs were evaluated by two different labs using different stereoscopic monitors: 24 subjects evaluated all stereo pairs at FUB on a LG 47”, and 22 subjects evaluated all stereo pairs at EPFL on a Hyundai S465D 46”. The purpose of this database is to benchmark objective metrics.
