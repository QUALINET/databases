The database focuses on 2 scalable video codecs: SVC and wavelet-based codec, 3 HD content videos, bit-rates ranging between 300 kbps and 4 Mbps, 3 spatial resolutions: 320x180, 640x360, and 1280x720, 4 temporal resolutions: 6.25 fps, 12.5 fps, 25 fps, 50 fps. In total, 28 and 44 video sequences were considered for each codec, respectively.
