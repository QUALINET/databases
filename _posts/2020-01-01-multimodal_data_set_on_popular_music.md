MusiClef data set is a multimodal data set of professionally annotated music. It includes editorial metadata about songs, albums, and artists, as well as MusicBrainz identifiers to facilitate linking to other data sets. In addition, several state-of-the-art audio features are provided. Different sets of annotations and music context data - collaboratively generated user tags, web pages about artists and albums, and the annotation labels provided by music experts - are included too. Versions of this data set were used in the MusiClef evaluation campaigns in 2011 and 2012 for auto-tagging tasks. The complete data set is publicly available for download at http://www.cp.jku.at/musiclef. The data set contains multimodal data on 1355 popular music songs by 218 leading artists, and is a considerably expanded version of the data set that was used for the MusiClef Multimodal Music Tagging Task at MediaEval 2012.
