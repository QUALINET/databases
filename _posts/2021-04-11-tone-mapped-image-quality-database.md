This database contains 20 high dynamic range (HDR) images (10 natural and 10 synthetic) with each pixel represented by its physical luminance. For each of these images, 9 tone-mapped versions were created and evaluated in two paired comparison subjective test - one with the HDR reference and the second one without. Four tone-mapping operators (TMOs) were used with two different parameter settings, plus one TMO without parameters was added as well. For more information, please, refer to the relevant paper or contact Lukas Krasula at L.Krasula@gmail.com.
