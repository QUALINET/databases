title: IRCCyN/IVC Eyetracker data for the Berkeley segmentation dataset
total: 84
---

The dataset contains eyetracking data from 25 observers for 84 uncompressed images from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/segbench/). There is no degradation on these images. A text file presents the general conditions of this test. It is a free task experiment.
