title: Web QoE Testing Content
---

Quality of web services represents an important issue for every service or content provider. Measurement of such services at the end-user side is not a trivial task, and various key factors are influencing the overall QoE perception. The aim of the Web QoE test content application provided here is to create a standardized news web page, which could be used for laboratory assessments for investigation of underlying key factors. Operator is able to change and affect page load times, or loading of certain elements, to simulate different network conditions, and measure their effect of the user\'s perception. To eliminate unwanted influences from network conditions outside of the lab, the project includes content harvesting script for downloading recent news from RSS feed specified in the config.
