This database contains 56 (28 QVGA and 28 VGA) videos sequences and the associated subjective results. 4 different video source contents were used in QVGA and the same 4 contents in VGA. For each content, the reference (without degradation) and 6 different degradations, in each format called Hypothetical Reference Circuits (HRCs) were subjectively evaluated.
The HRCs are based on H.264 and H.264/SVC coding without transmission errors. For each content, a SVC bitstream was created with 4 layers (2 in QVGA and 2 VGA)Some AVC bitstream were generated to compare each layer of the SVC coding with an AVC coding at the same bitrate and at the same PSNR.
