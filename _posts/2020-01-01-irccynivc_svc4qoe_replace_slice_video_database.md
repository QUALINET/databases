This database contains 9 contents with for each content, the reference (without processing or degradation) and 14 different HRCs. The HRCs are h264 and h264/SVC with simulated transmission errors. Several error concealments was tested using the h264/SVC capability. There is one spreadsheet with the individual score and the MOS for each video for the results of subjective test using ACR methodology. A text file presents the conditions in which the videos was evaluated.
