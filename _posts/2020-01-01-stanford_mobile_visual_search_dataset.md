Stanford Mobile Visual Search data set contains camera-phone images of products, CDs, books, outdoor landmarks, business cards, text documents, museum paintings and video clips. The data set has several key characteristics lacking in existing data sets: rigid objects, widely varying lighting conditions, perspective distortion, foreground and background clutter, realistic ground-truth reference data, and query data collected from heterogeneous low and high-end camera phones.
