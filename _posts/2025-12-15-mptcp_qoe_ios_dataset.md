This comprehensive dataset accompanies a peer-reviewed publication presented at the ACM Multimedia Systems Conference 2020 in Istanbul. The dataset contains measurements examining the impact of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) on Quality of Experience (QoE) for mobile applications on iOS devices.

The 25.2 GB dataset includes user study data covering three types of mobile applications: (i) interactive mobile games, (ii) HTTP adaptive video streaming, and (iii) infinite scroll web browsing. The dataset contains gateway data, phone data, proxy data, and survey data reflecting subjective user experience measurements. While Multipath TCP promises improvements in Quality of Service through connection bundling, this study investigates whether these technical improvements translate to actual improvements in user-perceived Quality of Experience.

The dataset is comprehensively documented with four descriptive PDFs explaining the different data components (Gateway, Phone, Proxy, and Survey data). This work represents a collaboration between three German research institutions.
