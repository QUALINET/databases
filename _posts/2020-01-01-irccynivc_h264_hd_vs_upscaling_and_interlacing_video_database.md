This database contains 87 videos sequences and the associated subjective results. 3 different video source contents were used. For each content, the reference (without degradation) and 28 different degradations called Hypothetical Reference Circuits (HRCs) were subjectively evaluated.
The HRCs are based on H.264 coding without transmission errors. There are 6 different formats (1920x1080p50, 1920x1080i50, 1280x720p50, 1280x1080i50, 1280x1080p50 and SD (720x576)) and 3 different bitrates (3Mb/s, 6Mb/s and 9Mb/s). All Processed Video Sequences (PVS) are displayed on a 1920x1080 progressive display so the SD and 720 are upscaled and the interleaved format are deinterlaced.
