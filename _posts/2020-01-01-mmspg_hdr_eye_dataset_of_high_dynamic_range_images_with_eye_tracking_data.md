To understand the influence on the human visual attention when a conventional LDR image is replaced with an HDR image, we created a new HDR public dataset that contains 46 HDR images together with their LDR versions and covers large variety of content. We conducted an eye tracking experiment involving 20 naive subjects to collect eye tracking data for these images using a professional eye tracking system Smart Eye Pro 5.8 and a commercially available HDR SIM2 monitor.
