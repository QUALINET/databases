To understand the implications of using UHD video in video surveillance, a dataset suitable for privacy evaluation is necessary. Existing public UHD datasets are mostly designed for evaluation of video compression and do not carry privacy sensitive information. And datasets dedicated to the evaluation of privacy issues, such as PEViD-HD (mmspg.epfl.ch/pevid-hd), contain at most HD video sequences. The dataset consists of 26 4K UHD video sequences, each 13 seconds long, with a frame resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels and captured at 30 fps using a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 smartphone. Resized sequences in HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) and SD (720 x 404 pixels) are also provided together with the original 4K UHD sequenes. Video sequences in the dataset depict several typical surveillance scenarios: walking, exchanging bags, fighting, and stealing, which were shot in outdoor and indoor environments. Participants appearing in the video have various gender and race, they are dressed differently and carry various personal items and accessories. Their silhouettes were manually annotated and the annotations are provided in XML format. All participants have read and signed a consent form, allowing free usage of these video sequences for research purposes.
