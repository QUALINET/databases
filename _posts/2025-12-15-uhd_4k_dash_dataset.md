This comprehensive dataset comprises both AVC (H.264) and HEVC (H.265) video content generated from three well-known open-source 4K video clips: Big Buck Bunny, Sintel, and Tears of Steel. The bitrates range from 40Mbps at 4K resolution down to 235kbps at 320x240, comparable to rates utilized by on-demand services such as Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime.

The 168.0 GB dataset supports both real-time testbed evaluation and trace-based simulation using ns-2 and ns-3 frameworks. It includes original MP4 files and DASH generation scripts, providing researchers with complete resources for reproducing and extending the work. The dataset contains multiple encoding profiles to enable comprehensive evaluation of Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) performance across various network conditions and device capabilities.

This work was conducted as part of the iVID project (Science Foundation Ireland Grant 13/IA/1892) at the Mobile and Internet Systems Laboratory (MISL) at University College Cork. The dataset was presented at ACM MMSys 2018 in Amsterdam.
