The 3D4YOU project will develop the key elements of a practical 3D television system, particularly, the definition of a 3D delivery format and guidelines for a 3D content creation process.The “Beer Garden” 3D test sequence is available, which is one of the 3D sequences that have been produced within the 3D4YOU project. This sequence has also been submitted to MPEG in response to its call for 3D content.
