Eye-tracking data were collected in order to better understand how people look to images under natural viewing conditions. Twenty-nine source images of the LIVE image quality assessment database were used as stimuli, and twenty participants were requested to look at the images in a natural way. A map indicating the natural scene saliency (NSS) was derived from the eye-tracking data. Dataset contains saliency maps for 29 reference images obtained using 20 observers.
