title: Commute Path Bandwidth Traces from 3G Networks
---

In this dataset we present and make available real-world measurements of the throughput that was achieved at the application layer when adaptive HTTP streaming was performed over 3G networks using mobile devices. For the streaming sessions, popular commute routes were used in and around Oslo (Norway) traveling with different types of public transportation (metro, tram, train, bus and ferry). Few logs are available using a car. Each log provides a times-tamp, GPS coordinates and the measured number of bytes downloaded for approximately every second of the route. The dataset can be used in several ways, but the most obvious application is to emulate the same network bandwidth behavior (on specific geographical positions) for repeated experiments.
