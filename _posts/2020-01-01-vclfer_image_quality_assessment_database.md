VCL@FER database consists of 575 images, 23 out of which are originals, with 4 different degradation types per image and 6 degrees of degradation. The degradation types are: JPEG2000, JPEG, Gaussian noise, White noise. Testing was conducted on 118 subjects who had to grade 11307 images in total (around 96 images per subject). Every image was evaluated between 16 and 36 times. Every subject had to grade different types of degradation in one session, e.g. sessions were not divided on degradation types. This will influence on objective measure performances. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) was calculated according to the Rec. ITU-R BT.500-11.
