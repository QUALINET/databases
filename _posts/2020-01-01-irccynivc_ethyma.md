The ETHyma eye-tracking images database contains 11 High Dynamic Range (HDR) images, the associated eye-tracking raw data and saliency maps. This database contains also 88 tone mapped images from HDR to Low Dynamic Range (standard images) and their associated eye-tracking raw data and saliency maps. The HDR images were displayed on an HDR display (Sim2 HDR47E S 4K) and the tone mapped images on a standard LCD.
