P2P-TV applications have attracted a lot of attention from the research community in the last years. Such systems generate a large amount of data which impacts the network performance. As a natural consequence, characterizing these systems has become a very important task to develop better multimedia systems. However, crawling data from P2P live streaming systems is particularly challenging by the fact that most of these applications have private protocols. This database contains a set of logs from a very popular P2P live streaming application, the SopCast. The logs and the characterization can be used as a starting point to the development of new live streaming systems.
