The CVQA dataset focuses on the compressed video quality assessment problem. It contains 1,022 distorted streams, produced from 36 reference videos, which were originally collected using space-time-complexity clustering from a pool of more that 18,000 videos with the average bitrate of 130 Mbps. Coding artifacts were obtained by compressing videos through several encoders (32 in total) of different compression standards: H.265/HEVC, H.266/VVC, AV1, H.264/AVC, and VP9. There were two different presets (30 FPS and 1 FPS) and three target bitrates — 1,000 kbps, 2,000 kbps, and 4,000 kbps. More than 320,000 subjective scores were collected through the Subjectify.us crowdsourcing platform, which employs a Bradley-Terry model to transform the results of pairwise voting into a score for each video. Content includes nature, sport, humans close up, gameplays, music videos, water stream or steam, CGI, and user-generated content. Several effects and distortions are also presented: shaking, slow-motion, grain / noisy, too dark / bright regions, macro shooting, captions (text), and extraneous objects.
