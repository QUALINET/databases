The dataset includes 12 HDR video sequences and 2 HDR video light probe sequences. The HDR video sequences are captured in different environments. Each full resolution frame from HDR video sequences is around 45 MB in size. The sequences have therefore been downsampled to 720p, i.e. 1280x720 pixels. All frames are stored in the OpenEXR file format.
