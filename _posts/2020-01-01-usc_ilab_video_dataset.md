The collected 50 uncompressed YUV format video clips were presented to 14 subjects and their eye fixation points were recorded over frames from each clip by an eye-tracker machine. The recorded eye traces represent the subjects' shifting overt attention, thus the eye-tracking data are qualified to validate the performance of the attention prediction model and the visual subjective quality.
