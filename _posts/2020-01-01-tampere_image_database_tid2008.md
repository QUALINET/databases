A color image database for evaluation of image quality metrics is available from the Tampere University of Technology. The Tampere Image Database (TID2008) contains a large amount of test images distorted with various techniques, e.g. different types of noise, blur, JPEG and JPEG2000 compression and transmission with errors, local distortions, luminance and contrast changes. The database contains 25 reference images (Kodak Lossless True Color Image Suite, http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/), 1700 distorted images (17 types of distortion at 4 levels of distortion). The MOS is a result of 838 experiments with 8387 observers resulting into 512856 evaluations of relative visual quality in image pairs.
