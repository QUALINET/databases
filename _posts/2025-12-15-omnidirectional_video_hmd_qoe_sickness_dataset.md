This dataset contains quality of experience (QoE) and simulator sickness measurements for omnidirectional video content viewed across different head-mounted display (HMD) devices. The research examined integral quality, motion sickness, head movements, and simulator sickness questionnaire responses across multiple HMD platforms including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.

The 3.2 MB dataset includes the study description, links to video content, and subject response data from the QoMEX 2017 study conducted at TU Ilmenau. The research provides valuable insights into how different HMD technologies affect both perceived quality and physiological comfort when viewing 360-degree video content.

This work was a collaboration between the Audiovisual Technology Group at TU Ilmenau and Telekom Innovation Laboratories at Deutsche Telekom AG. The research has been widely cited in subsequent studies on virtual reality video quality assessment and simulator sickness evaluation for 360-degree video content, contributing to standardization efforts such as ITU-T recommendations for subjective evaluation of VR content.
