This open-source dataset contains mouse movement data collected from three distinct subjective video quality tests, representing different testing environments: crowd-sourced, out-of-the-lab, and laboratory settings. The dataset is accompanied by an enhanced version of the AVrateVoyager framework, a web-based platform for conducting subjective quality assessment studies.

The repository is structured with an AVrateVoyager folder containing the modified software for collecting mouse movement data, and a dataset folder with the actual mouse movement recordings. This behavioral interaction data provides insights into how users navigate and interact with video content during quality assessment tasks, particularly in different testing environments.
