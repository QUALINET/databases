Subjective ratings from 24 participants from Audiovisual assessment campaign. Degraded videos by request (intact original videos are from The Consumer Digital Video Library). In the campaign Audiovisual vote, audio vote and video vote about quality was asked about 125 streamed video samples that were degraded by introducing packet losses. The database can be used to train and validate parametric models with independent variables resolution, amount of movement, packet loss and burstiness.
