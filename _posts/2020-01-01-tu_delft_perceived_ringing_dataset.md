The subjective data on perceived ringing were collected with the aim to better understand where human beings perceive ringing artifacts in compressed images, and to develop a no-reference (NR) metric to predict perceived ringing annoyance in these compressed images. The data result from two perception experiments: 1. the so-called ringing region experiment, and 2. the so-called ringing annoyance experiment. For the ringing region experiment, eight source images were JPEG compressed at two levels, yielding a database of 16 stimuli. Twelve participants were requested to mark any region in each stimulus where ringing was perceived, independent of its annoyance. The results were transformed into a subjective ringing region (SRR) map, indicating where in an image on average people see ringing. For the ringing annoyance experiment, eleven source images were JPEG compressed at four levels, yielding a test database of 55 stimuli (including the originals). Twenty participants scored the annoyance of the ringing artifacts with a single-stimulus scoring method. A mean opinion score (MOS) was obtained for each stimulus.
