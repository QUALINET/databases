The TUM 1080p50 Data Set consists of the subjective test results and bitstreams of five different HDTV 1080p50 video sequences of the SVT test set (CrowdRun, TreeTilt, PrincessRun, DanceKiss and FlagShoot), encoded with H.264/AVC resulting in rate points between 2-40 MBit/s, resulting in 20 different data points. The subjective test were run in four scenarios: - (1 ) Reference monitor (Sony BVM-L230, 23"), (2) Consumer LCD display  (Sony KDL-55X4500, 56"), (2) LCoS Projector (JVC DLA-HD750, 2.8m), LCoS Projector & 7.1 surround sound (JVC DLA-HD750, 2.8m).
