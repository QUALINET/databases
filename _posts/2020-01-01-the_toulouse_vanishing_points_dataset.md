title: The Toulouse Vanishing Points Dataset

In this paper we present the Toulouse Vanishing Points Dataset, a public photographs database of Manhattan scenes taken with an iPad Air 1. The purpose of this dataset is the evaluation of vanishing points estimation algorithms. Its originality is the addition of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data synchronized with the camera under the form of rotation matrices. Moreover, contrary to existing works which provide vanishing points of reference in the form of single points, we computed uncertainty regions.
