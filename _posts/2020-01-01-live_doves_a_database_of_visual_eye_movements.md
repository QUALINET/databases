DOVES (a Database Of Visual Eye movementS) is a collection of eye movements from 29 human observers as they viewed 101 natural calibrated images. Recorded using a high-precision dual-Purkinje eye tracker, the database consists of around 30,000 fixation points, and is believed to be the first large-scale database of eye movements to be made available to the vision research community.
